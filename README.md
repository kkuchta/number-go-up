# Number Go Up

Based on [this silly tweet](https://twitter.com/evoroxv/status/1267323832945315840) about an rpg stripped to its essentials, I decided to spend an afternoon hacking together a working version. This is React (via Create-React-App) with Typescript and deployed on netlify at [number-go-up.com](https://number-go-up.com/).

I also used it as an excuse to checkout TailwindCSS. I'm still not convinced that it's not just the worst parts of Bootstrap and stock CSS, but I'm warming up to it a bit.

## Usage

`yarn start` will run a development server at localhost:3000

`yarn build` will output the built site to `/build`
